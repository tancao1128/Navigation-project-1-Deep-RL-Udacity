# Project 1: Navigation

### Introduction

This project repository contains work for the Udacity's [Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893) Project 1: Navigation.

For this project, we will train an agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.

### About Deep Reinforcement Learning

> [Reinforcement learning](https://skymind.ai/wiki/deep-reinforcement-learning) refers to goal-oriented algorithms, which learn how to attain a complex objective (goal) or maximize along a particular dimension over many steps; for example, maximize the points won in a game over many moves. They can start from a blank slate, and under the right conditions they achieve superhuman performance. Like a child incentivized by spankings and candy, these algorithms are penalized when they make the wrong decisions and rewarded when they make the right ones â€“ this is reinforcement.


This project implement a Value Based method called [Deep Q-Networks](https://deepmind.com/research/dqn/)


### Environment details

The environment is based on [Unity ML-agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents)

Note: The project environment provided by Udacity is similar to, but not identical to the [Banana Collector](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#banana-collector) environment on the Unity ML-Agents GitHub page.

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.  Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.  

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction.  Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions.  Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:
- **`0`** - move forward.
- **`1`** - move backward.
- **`2`** - turn left.
- **`3`** - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Getting Started

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)

    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the environment.

2. Place the file in the DRLND GitHub repository, in the `p1_navigation/` folder, and unzip (or decompress) the file. 

3. Clone Unity ML-Agents [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents).

4. The Unity ML-Agent team frequently releases updated versions of their environment. We are using the **v0.4** interface. Please checkout to v0.4 and install the Unity ML-Agent. [Installation Instructions](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/0.4.0b/docs/Installation.md)
